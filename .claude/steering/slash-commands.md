# Slash Commands

Trigger: slash command / add command / /command / new command / SlashCommandContext

There are two kinds of slash commands:

## 1. UI-handled commands (in `App.tsx`)

Commands that need direct access to React state (UI, overlays, token counters) are handled inline in `handleSubmit` in `src/ui/App.tsx`. These short-circuit before the slash command registry.

**Current UI commands:** `/model` (`/m`), `/compact` (`/c`), `/quit` (`/q`, `/exit`), `/clear`

To add a new UI command:
1. Add a condition in `handleSubmit` after the existing checks:
   ```tsx
   if (trimmed === "/mycommand") {
     // manipulate React state directly
     setLiveItems([{ kind: "info", text: "Done.", id: getId() }]);
     return;
   }
   ```
2. If the command needs to reset agent state, call `agentLoop.reset()`.

## 2. Registry commands (in `core/slash-commands.ts`)

Commands that don't need React state live in `createBuiltinCommands()` in `src/core/slash-commands.ts`. They receive a `SlashCommandContext` with methods like `switchModel`, `compact`, `newSession`, `quit`, etc.

**Current registry commands:** `/model` (`/m`), `/compact` (`/c`), `/help` (`/h`, `/?`), `/settings` (`/config`), `/session` (`/s`), `/new` (`/n`), `/quit` (`/q`, `/exit`)

Note: `/model`, `/compact`, and `/quit` exist in both — the UI handlers in `App.tsx` take precedence since they're checked first.

To add a new registry command:
1. Add an entry to the array in `createBuiltinCommands()`:
   ```ts
   {
     name: "mycommand",
     aliases: ["mc"],
     description: "Does something useful",
     usage: "/mycommand [args]",
     execute(args, ctx) {
       // Use ctx methods or return a string to display
       return "Result text";
     },
   },
   ```
2. If the command needs new capabilities, add the method to `SlashCommandContext` interface and wire it up in `AgentSession.createSlashCommandContext()`.

## When to Use Which

| Need | Where |
|---|---|
| Modify UI state (history, overlays, live items) | `App.tsx` |
| Reset token counters | `App.tsx` (call `agentLoop.reset()`) |
| Access agent session (messages, auth, settings) | `slash-commands.ts` registry |
| Both UI + session access | `App.tsx` (can call session methods via props) |

There is also support for **prompt-template commands** (built-in from `core/prompt-commands.ts` and custom from `.gg/commands/` directory).
